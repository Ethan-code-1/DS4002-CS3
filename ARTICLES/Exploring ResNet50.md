## What is ResNet50?

**ResNet50** is a deep convolutional neural network

## High-Level Overview: How Image Classification Works

1. **Input Image**  
   An image is fed into the model, usually resized to a consistent dimension (224Ã—224 pixels for ResNet50).

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   Early layers detect low-level features

3. **Classification**  
   Later layers combine with earlier layers to recognize bigger, more complicated patterns and allow classification (In this case study classification is binary as either a 'drawing' or 'painting')

4. **Prediction**  
   The final output is a class label based on the highest probability.
