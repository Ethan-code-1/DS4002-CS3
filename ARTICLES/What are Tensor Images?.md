# What Does It Mean to Make an Image a Tensor?

## Images as Data

- Images: made up of tiny **pixels**.
- Each pixel has a color stored as **RGB** values:
- Each color value (R, G, and B ) usually ranges from 0 to 255.

## What Is a Tensor?

- **tensor** : a multi-dimensional array containing numbers that stores information about an image in a format that is easy for machine learning models such as ResNet to process.
