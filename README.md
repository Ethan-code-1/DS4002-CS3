# DS4002-CS3

## Getting Started
1. Consult the Hook Document
2. Consult the Rubric to understand case study goals and submission requirements
3. Review Articles found in ARTICLES folder
- Consider reading the files in this order: "AI and Art Classification" -> "What are Tensor Images?" -> "Exploring ResNet50" 
4. After completing the associated readings review the format of the data
5. Once familiar with the structure of the data consult the scripts section to begin. 

## FAQS

## Where to find the Data?
The data for this assignment can be found in the DATA folder. The data is called MetMuseumData.

## What is a high level overview of what I am doing?
You will be creating a image classification model. This model will build of the existing ResNet50 model found within the installed libraries. This pre-built model will help abstract away a lot of the complexity associated with building a machine learning model. 

## What libraries will I need installed to complete this case study?
Considering installing:
